PROBLEMS: 
- We want to understand the distribution of customers and their account types (Current Account, Fixed Deposit, Gold Loan, Recurring Deposit, Overdraft) across the branches.
- Analyzing transaction types (credit or debit) and the amount of money flowing in or out of accounts. Also, identify the top customers based on transaction volume and amount.
- We want to analyze which product type is most popular in each region and understand the overall performance of each branch in terms of product distribution and transaction activity.
